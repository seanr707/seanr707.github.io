Source code for my portfolio / GH-pages.

Pages build using:

* React
* Redux
* Webpack
* Babel

Note: Files under `public` folder may be minified; view `app` folder for source files.

What to implement next:

* React Router
* Gh-pages for projects instead of Codepen.io/seanr707
* Add buttons to link to GH-page and source for each project
* Increase height of project tile to allow for buttons to fit
* Add propType validation to components
* Reformat layout of application
